    <h1>Why Video Games mean a lot to me</h1>
    <p>by Mathew Medina</p>

<h2>Genres</h2>
<p>My most two favorite genres of video games are platforming 2d and 3d and my beloved, Role-Playing Games.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Here are my top 3 favorite RPGs.</p>

<ul>

    <li>EarthBound</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy 9</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my top 4 platforming games:</p>

<ol>
    <li>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</li>
    <li>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</li>
    <li>Celeste</li>
    <li>Super Mario Galaxy</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p><em>Honestly, video games are always inspiration for me.</p>

<p>They have the most<strong>beautiful soundtrack, stories, grapics, and controls.</strong>Of course depending on the game you're playing but you gotta know and see what game is best for your taste and I'm always careful for it.</p>
<p><em><strong>And I pick the best of the best!</strong></em></p>

<h2>Leaving</h2>

<p>Sometimes I feel like playing video games for reasons. I don't worry or think about anything terrible. I just focus, think, and play video games. That's what I love about them. It never works for tv shows and movies. Only video games and that's another reason why I love them.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, <br/>

<p>P.S. If you don't play them yet or don't own a console or play big ones on PC, what's wrong with you?</p>
